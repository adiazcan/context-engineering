# Planning with Clarification

Briefly analyze my feature request, then ask me 3-5 targeted questions 
to clarify:

1. **Scope and boundaries**: What's in scope and out of scope?
2. **User experience**: How should this feature behave from a user perspective?
3. **Technical constraints**: Are there specific technologies or patterns 
   that must be used or avoided?
4. **Integration points**: How does this interact with existing features?
5. **Success criteria**: How will we know this feature is complete and working?

Only after I answer your questions, proceed with creating a detailed 
implementation plan following the standard planning workflow.
